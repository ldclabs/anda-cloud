# `anda_x402_canister`

A fully on-chain x402 payment facilitator on the Internet Computer, part of [Anda Cloud](https://github.com/ldclabs/anda-cloud).

## Overview

`anda_x402_canister` is an ICP smart contract that functions as a payment facilitator based on the [x402 Protocol](https://www.x402.org). It handles payment verification and settlement for services within the Anda Cloud ecosystem, supporting multiple ICRC-2 compatible tokens.

## Features

- Implements the x402 payment protocol for decentralized payments.
- Supports multiple ICRC-2 compatible tokens as payment assets.
- Provides both Candid and HTTP APIs.
- Manages payment states, fees, and transaction logs on-chain.
- Supports both JSON and CBOR content types for the HTTP API.
- Fully deployed as a smart contract on the decentralized ICP blockchain, governed by ICPanda DAO.

## Quick Start

### Client Typescript SDK

```bash
npm install @ldclabs/anda_x402
```

npmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ldclabs/anda_x402

source: https://github.com/ldclabs/anda-cloud/tree/main/ts/anda_x402

### Integration Example

https://github.com/ldclabs/anda-cloud/tree/main/examples/ts/anda_x402/app.ts

### Local Deployment

Deploy the canister:
```bash
# dfx canister create --specified-id ogkpr-lyaaa-aaaap-an5fq-cai anda_x402_canister
dfx deploy anda_x402_canister --argument "(opt variant {Init =
  record {
    name = \"Anda X402 Facilitator\";
    governance_canister = opt principal \"dwv6s-6aaaa-aaaaq-aacta-cai\";
  }
})"
```

Add supported asset:
```bash
# Add the PANDA token as a supported asset, payment fee is 0.1 PANDA
dfx canister call anda_x402_canister admin_update_supported_asset '(principal "druyg-tyaaa-aaaaq-aactq-cai", 10_000_000)'
# Check the canister info
dfx canister call anda_x402_canister info '()'
```

### Candid API

The canister exposes a comprehensive Candid API. Key endpoints include:

```did
// Get canister information and state
info : () -> (Result_2) query;

// Get the next valid nonce for the caller to make a payment
next_nonce : () -> (Result_4) query;

// Get payment logs for the caller
my_payment_logs : (nat32, opt nat64) -> (Result_3) query;

// --- Administration ---

// Add a supported payment kind (version and scheme)
admin_add_supported_payment : (X402Version, Scheme) -> (Result);

// Remove a supported payment kind
admin_remove_supported_payment : (X402Version, Scheme) -> (Result);

// Add or update a supported ICRC-1 asset
admin_update_supported_asset : (principal, nat) -> (Result);

// Remove a supported asset
admin_remove_supported_asset : (principal) -> (Result);

// Collect fees from the canister
admin_collect_fees : (principal, principal, nat) -> (Result_1);
```

### HTTP API

The canister supports HTTP requests for payment operations. Please see [x402 Protocol Specification](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/specs/x402-specification.md) for details.

#### Facilitator Endpoints

- `GET /`: Get canister info, including supported assets and payment kinds.
- `GET /supported`: Get a list of supported payment kinds.
- `POST /verify`: Verify a payment authorization without settling.
- `POST /settle`: Settle a payment by transferring funds.

#### Content Types

The HTTP API supports both JSON and CBOR formats. The content type is determined by the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers:

- For JSON: `application/json`
- For CBOR: `application/cbor`

## Data Types

### ICP Payment Payload

The core data structure representing the payment payload for ICP chain:

```ts
export interface IcpPayload {
  /// ICP based signature over the authorization data in base64 format
  signature: string
  /// Authorization parameters for the payment
  authorization: IcpPayloadAuthorization
}

export interface IcpPayloadAuthorization {
  /// Payment scheme identifier
  scheme: 'exact' | 'upto'
  /// token ledger canister address
  asset: string
  /// Recipient's wallet address
  to: string
  /// Payment amount in atomic units.
  /// For `exact` scheme, this is the exact amount to be transferred.
  /// For `upto` scheme, this is the maximum amount that can be transferred.
  value: string
  /// Unix timestamp when authorization expires (in milliseconds)
  expiresAt: number
  /// A self-incrementing number and should be used to prevent replay attacks.
  nonce: number
}
```
